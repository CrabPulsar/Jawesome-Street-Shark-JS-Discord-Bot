# Jawesome-Street-Shark-JS-Discord-Bot
A Discord JavaScript Bot
Hello, my name is CrabPulsar. I created this bot as a hobby and figured that I would share it with anyone who wanted it. Since I created it as a hobby please do not take it too seriously. I have copied a lot of code from different places and tried to make a general-purpose bot capable of performing some fun and hopefully unique commands. I hope that you enjoy using my bot or just simply taking a look at how it works.

If you want to contact me send me a dm through discord. My username is CrabPulsar#2176.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I hope you enjoy using my bot. I will try adding more features in the future, but, like I said, it's just a hobby as of right now.




To Set Up The Bot:

1. If you have never worked with discord bots before I highly recommend watching a YouTube video on the process because it is hard to explain just using text.
2. Go to the botconfig.json file and replace the prefix with whichever prefix you want. My server using the acronym "jss" which is short for Jawesome Street Shark. It is a reference to the tv show Street Sharks that was a meme on my server.
3. Also change the token to you bot token from the discord bot portal website. If you want to use the Random Cat or the Random Dog commands you need to create an account with the respective site and get an api key.
4. Open up a terminal and make sure that it contain the entire folder (should look something like C:\Users\your name\Discord_Bot> ) and then run the command "npm i". This will install all the node modules that are required to run the bot.
5. If you and your server are going to use the mute and unmute commands, make sure that your server has a role name exactly "Muted" or else the command won't work (I know it's bad, I'm still trying to fix this).
6. Some commands may not work if the bot does not have high enough roles, I recommend adding the bot as an administrator.
7. You should be ready to go. Have fun with the bot and feel free to reach out to me or change the code yourself.
